# Improved Kidney Stone Recognition Through Attention and Multi-View Feature Fusion Strategies



This repository has the code to implement the methods described in the conference article: [*Improved Kidney Stone Recognition Through Attention and Multi-View Feature Fusion Strategies*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.02967.pdf), developed as part of the project [*"RECONDITE: Deep learning and image analysis methods for improving the endoscopic identification of kidney stones composition"*](https://www.researchgate.net/project/RECONDITE-Deep-learning-and-image-analysis-methods-for-improving-the-endoscopic-identification-of-kidney-stones-composition) at [Tecnologico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/en) and [Universit√© de Lorraine](http://www.univ-lorraine.fr). 



## Abstract
This contribution presents a deep learning method for the extraction and fusion of information relating to kidney stone fragments acquired from different viewpoints of the endoscope. Surface and section fragment images are jointly used during the training of the classifier to improve the discrimination power of the features by adding attention layers at the end of each convolutional block. This approach is specifically designed to mimic the morpho-constitutional analysis performed in ex-vivo by biologists to visually identify kidney stones by inspecting both views. The addition of attention mechanisms to the backbone improved the results of single view extraction backbones by 4% on average. Moreover, in comparison to the state-of-the-art, the fusion of the deep features improved the overall results up to 11% in terms of kidney stone classification accuracy.
